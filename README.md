# Web Components with Polymer

This is a presentation I gave about creating web components with the Polymer library. This code example was written with Polymer version 0.5.4 which has syntax that is different from the official 1.0 version that was designed to match the web component specification set forth for inclusion in HTML6.

## Well Plate submodule

Currently, the well plate submodule is missing from the code base. I accidentally missed it when I creating copies of projects. If I can acquire a copy of it, I will update the project.
